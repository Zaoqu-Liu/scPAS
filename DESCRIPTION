Description: Identifies phenotype-associated cell subpopulations from single-cell RNA-seq 
    data by integrating bulk RNA-seq data with phenotype information. This package uses 
    network-regularized sparse regression to quantify the strength of association between 
    each cell and a phenotype (e.g., disease stage, tumor metastasis, treatment response, 
    survival outcomes). Compatible with Seurat v4 (4.0.0-4.4.0) and SeuratObject v4 
    (4.0.0-4.1.4). The method supports Gaussian (continuous), binomial (binary), and 
    Cox (survival) regression families. Version 1.0.0 includes critical bug fixes for 
    sparse matrix operations, improved robustness, and parallel computing support.
